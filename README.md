#Overtale-Python-Quest

This is just me studying Python from my university circle 'Overtale'

Loan rate calculator programs.

Click the CalenderCalc.py to change year and month to day.

Click the CoinCalc.py to calculate the Korean coins.

Click the TempCalc.py to change Fahrenheit to Celsius.

Click the LoanCalc.py to calculate Loan rate.
